In order to install this code-base on a Google App Engine site, please follow the below steps

Steps
=======
1) Download the latest Google App Engine SDK from https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
2) Extract the SDK and copy app.yaml and assets/ directory into it
3) Launch the webserver by typing "./dev_appserver.py ." within the SDK directory. On doing so, you should
be able to access the site at http://localhost:8080
4) Make sure that you are added as a developer for unc-desi.appspot.com by emailing me at "ravikirn (at) cs.unc.edu" before
you can push changes to the site. For developmental purposes, I would suggest creating a new appengine site and modify
app.yaml file to get it working.
5) If you want to learn the details about App Engine (Python), take a look at the documentation at https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/overview.
